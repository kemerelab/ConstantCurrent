# ConstantCurrent
Circuits for driving constant current stimulators for electrical biphasic pulses and diodes.

### Currently in Prototyping stage

1. 3A LED driver.
2. Constant current biphasic pulses using low power op amps.

### Goals

1. Integrate with https://github.com/kemerelab/pi-stimserver project.
